For binary search to work, it is mandaatory for the target array to be sorted. It reasches a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If match occurs then index of item is returned. If middle item is greater than item then item is searched in sub-array to the right of the middle item othewise item is searchend in sub-array to the left of the middle item. This process continue on sub-array until the size of subarray reduces to zero.

Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complezity of O(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer.
